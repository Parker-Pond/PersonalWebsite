        <h3>To whom it may concern</h3>
        <p>I am a dedicated and hard working employee. I am compleeting a course on full stack web development from Fullstack Academy. </p>
        <p> there is no task to small, or project to large. I love a challenge but I am also fine doing the grunt work which many people are disinclined from doing</p>
        <p> though my years in manegment I have learned the value of every position and I am far more focused on getting my team to where we need to go, not just how I look doing it.</p>

        <h3>A little about me</h3>
        <p>My name is Parker, and I am from Las Vegas. I married in 2018 to my beautiful wife Julie. She is a special ed pre-school teacher in a school near our house. </p>
        <p>I studied psychology, entrepreneurship, and business in college but never felt satisfied with my options. I decided to open a restaurant, so I started running them as an assistant manager to learn the ropes. Having lost every weekend for the last few years I decided that opening a restaurant was not for me.  </p>
        <p>I remembers my love for web development in high school and decided to try my hand at it. I fell back in love with it and decided to take a more structured and guided path via a Bootcamp. </p>
        <p>My local college partnered with Fullstack Academy, so I decided to trust my beloved school. I have been loving the program and look forward to getting into the field. </p>
