    <center><h2>Things About Me</h2></center>
    <p>My name is Parker, and I am from Las Vegas. I married in 2018 to my beautiful wife Julie. She is a special ed pre-school teacher in a school near our house. </p>
    <p>I studied psychology, entrepreneurship, and business in college but never felt satisfied with my options. I decided to open a restaurant, so I started running them as an assistant manager to learn the ropes. Having lost every weekend for the last few years I decided that opening a restaurant was not for me.  </p>
    <p>I remembers my love for web development in high school and decided to try my hand at it. I fell back in love with it and decided to take a more structured and guided path via a Bootcamp. </p>
    <p>My local college partnered with Fullstack Academy, so I decided to trust my beloved school. I have been loving the program and look forward to getting into the field. </p>
